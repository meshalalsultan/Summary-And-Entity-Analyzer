# Summary and Entity Analyzer

## Overview
Dive into the world of Natural Language Processing with the Summary and Entity Analyzer! This project utilizes advanced NLP techniques to provide concise summaries and detailed entity analysis of textual content. Ideal for students, researchers, and anyone interested in extracting insights from articles quickly and effectively.

## Features
- **Article Summarization**: Get to the heart of any article with our quick summarization tool, designed to save you time and effort.
- **Entity Recognition**: Discover key entities such as names, places, and organizations within the text, enhancing your understanding of the subject matter.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Built with simplicity in mind, our tool ensures that everyone can benefit from the power of NLP without any prior expertise.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main application file where the Streamlit interface is defined.
- `Pipfile` & `Pipfile.lock`: Defines the project's python dependencies.
- `procfile`: Specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python libraries.
- `setup.sh`: Configuration settings for initializing the app.

## Getting Started
